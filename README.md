## Description: 
Marvel Wiki is a React app that uses the offical Marvel API to pull data (https://developer.marvel.com/docs). The app allows users to find any information they want about a certain Marvel character or comic, all a user needs to do is enter the name or titl of a character or comic and any matching results will pop up on the page.

## Unsolved problems: 
No error if search does not yield results. 
Characters and comics are not clickable and do not bring up any information about them. 

## Major Hurdles: 
My API really slowed me down, getting the data to come back was difficult since everything I wanted was buried deep down in the results. But once I figured out how the API worked it didn't really bring me any trouble besides getting data. 

My API was not up to date certain major characters didn't have any descriptions and many links to external sites were broken as well as a lot of images for the characters and comics. 

Styling during this project was a huge pain. Getting everything the way I wanted on top of making it responsive was tough. It required a lot of googling and questions in order to get my app to look presentable.
